Can be flexibly combined
: The two service models can be combined: For example, if Mr. Sample daily signs contracts with various external parties, we recommend the flat rate plan for Mr. Sample and the prepaid plan for the external parties.

The more, the less expensive
: We have a volume-based pricing model: the more signatures you purchase in a prepaid plan, the lower the unit price. The more people you sign up for the flat rate plan, the lower the monthly flat rate per person.
