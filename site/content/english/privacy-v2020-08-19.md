### 1. General information
Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and data protection provisions (Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, FADP), and according to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), every person has a right to privacy and protection from misuse of their personal data. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your data as confidential and handle it in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and our privacy policy.

The terms used in this policy are the terms defined in Article 4 GDPR. 

We work together with our service providers and partners to protect all data processing operations from unauthorised access, loss, misuse and unauthorised changes, as effectively as possible and in accordance with the **current state of the art.**

#### 1.1 Legal basis
Our legal basis for using your data depends on

- the services that you use (contract or pre-contractual measures, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR); 
- our need to comply with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR);
- consent that you have given us (consent, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR); or 
- a legitimate interest, such as ensuring the security of the website (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).

#### 1.2 Purposes
We use your data for **purposes** including

- providing our service to you and keeping that service up and running;
- informing you of changes to our service;
- providing customer service;
- collecting analytical data and other valuable data so that we can improve our service;
- monitoring use of our service;
- recognising, preventing and correcting problems;
- sending you news, special offers and general information on other products, services and events we offer, as long as they are similar to those that you have already purchased - from us or enquired about with us, and provided that you have not disabled such notifications.

#### 1.3 Processing of personal data
We process personal data in line with the EU GDPR and Swiss data protection law. Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. 

We process your data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the relevant purpose or purposes. When we are required to retain personal data beyond that period because we are subject to statutory and other obligations, we restrict processing accordingly.

### Processing on our website (www.skribble.com)

#### 2.1 SSL/TLS encryption on our website
We use SSL/TLS encryption on our website for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as enquiries that you send to us. You can identify an encrypted connection because the address in your browser changes from http:// to https:// and, depending on the browser, if a padlock symbol is displayed in the browser bar.

When SSL or TLS encryption is enabled, third parties cannot read information that you send us via the [contact form](https://help.skribble.com/kb-tickets/new?pk_vid=06c20491bde368b31593602051c78024).

Please note that the transmission of data via the internet (e.g. when communicating by email) may be subject to security vulnerabilities. It is not possible to fully protect data from third-party access without using some type of **email encryption**, such as PGP or S/MIME, and you do so at your own risk. 

#### 2.2 Collection of server log files
You can generally visit our website without registering. When you visit our website, we store information on our server, such as the pages you access or the names of the files you open, along with the date and time of access, for statistical purposes. However, this data is not personal data.

We automatically collect and store information in **server log files** that your browser automatically sends to us. This information consists of:

- Browser type and version
- Operating system used
- Referrer URL
- Host name of the computer accessing our site
- Time of the server request
- IP address.

We can only associate this information with individuals indirectly. We will not combine this data with other sources of data. We reserve the right to review this data at a later point in time if we become aware of specific indications of unlawful use.

### 3. Rights of data subjects
Data protection legislation grants you the following rights as a data subject. To exercise one or more of these rights, simply contact our data protection officer.

#### 3.1 Right of access
You have the right to request confirmation from us regarding whether or not we process personal data concerning you and, if we do, you have the right to access that personal data and the information described in **Article 15 GDPR**.

#### 3.2 Right to rectification
As a data subject, you can change personal data that we have stored for you at any time or you can have us **rectify** it for you. 

#### 3.3 Right to erasure 
As a data subject, you can submit a request for erasure at any time. Unless we are required by law or some other obligation to continue to retain your data, we will gladly grant your request. If we cannot erase your data, we will restrict its processing.

You can **delete** your account on your own in your **profile settings**. We would be happy to assist you with that.

#### 3.4 Right to data portability
You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that we process on the basis of your consent or a contract in a **structured, commonly used and machine-readable format**, and the right to transmit that data to another controller, if needed.

#### 3.5 Right to object
Every data subject has the right to object to the processing of their personal data at any time on grounds relating to their particular situation.
We will no longer process that personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

#### 3.6 Withdrawing your consent
You can withdraw your consent at any time once you have given it. To do so, send an informal request to our **data protection officer** or use our [contact form](https://help.skribble.com/kb-tickets/new?pk_vid=06c20491bde368b31593702447c78024) or the opt-out link in our newsletter.

As the data controller, you decide what data to send to us for authentication. We would be happy to send you a processing agreement. Just let us know if you would like us to do so.

#### 4.3 Your details for paid services
When we provide paid services, we ask for additional data, such as payment details, so that we can process your order. We store this data in our system until the statutory retention period ends.
