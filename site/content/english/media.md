Skribble was founded in March 2018 with a mission to ensure trust between people in digital business relationships.
In practical terms, this currently means that we are making the qualified electronic signature (QES) widely applicable - the only form of digital signature that is equivalent to a handwritten signature before the law. Skribble has X employees and is active in Switzerland and the EU.
