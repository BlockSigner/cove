Identification
for electronic signing
===============
Each e-signature must be uniquely attributable to one person.
Therefore, Skribble requires the identification of the signatories.
The procedures differ depending on the type of contract.

# Contracts without written form
The simple electronic signature (SES) or the advanced electronic signature (AES) is typically used for contracts without formal requirements. The identification requirements for EES and FES are low to medium.

In the case of the simple electronic signature (EES), the signatories are identified by their e-mail address. Anyone who has a Skribble account or is invited to sign by e-mail can sign with EES without any further measures.

Companies that record the identity of their employees by default can activate AES via the company e-mail address. Anyone with a corresponding e-mail address can sign with AES immediately.

Swiss telecom providers are obliged to record the ID or passport of their customers before signing a contract. Anyone registering on Skribble with a Swiss mobile phone number can sign immediately with AES.

## Contracts requiring the written form
For contracts requiring the written form, the qualified electronic signature (QES) is typically used. The identification requirements for the QES are high, the identification must be done face-to-face or online via video.

A representative of your company goes through a one-time training. Afterwards he can identify the signatories himself face-to-face. Suitable for companies with a large number of QES signatories.

{{< picture id-direct 210 "A man is sitting in front of a laptop, above him is a sotware window, where a woman stands out with a big magnifying glass and checks an identity card." >}}

The signatories enable the QES by having themselves identified online via video (EU) or face-to-face at an identification site (Switzerland). Suitable for individuals and companies with a small number of QES signatories.

{{% collapsible 10 "When do I use which signature standard?" %}}
The simple electronic signature (SES) and the advanced electronic signature (AES) are legally valid for all contracts for which the law does not prescribe a specific form (contracts without the written form). You use the qualified electronic signature (QES) for contracts with a written requirement or to meet internal compliance requirements. You can find examples and more information at: https://www.skribble.com/signaturestandards/
{{% /collapsible %}}

{{% collapsible 11 "Which identification measures are required for the simple electronic signature (SES)?" %}}
With SES, the e-mail address serves as an identification element. The e-mail address must be confirmed by clicking on a link that is sent to the corresponding e-mail address.
{{% /collapsible %}}

{{% collapsible 12 "Why is identification different for SES, AES and QES?" %}}
The legal identification requirements are not the same. QES is the highest standard and is equivalent to a handwritten signature. The identification requirements for QES are precisely defined in the law. With SES and AES, providers have more freedom. When selecting identification procedures for SES and AES, Skribble pays attention to simplicity of use and maximisation of legal weight.
