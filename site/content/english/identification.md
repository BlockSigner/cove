# Identity verification for electronic signing
Each e-signature must be uniquely attributable to one person. 
Therefore, Skribble requires the identification of the signatories. 
The procedures differ depending on the application.

# Contracts without written form
The advanced electronic signature (AES) is typically used for contracts 
without formal requirements. With AES, the law requires that the identity 
of the signatory can be reconstructed afterwards.

Companies that record the identity of their employees by default can activate AES via the company e-mail address. Anyone with a corresponding e-mail address can sign with AES immediately.

# Contracts requiring the written form
For contracts requiring the written form, the qualified electronic signature (QES) is typically used. With QES, the law requires that the identity of the signatory be verified in advance in personal contact.

{{% collapsible 10 "When do I use which signature standard?" %}}
The advanced electronic signature (AES) is legally valid for all contracts for which the law does not prescribe a specific form (contracts without the written form). You use the qualified electronic signature (QES) for contracts with a written requirement or to meet internal compliance requirements. You can find examples and more information at https://www.skribble.com/signaturestandards/
{{% /collapsible %}}

{{% collapsible 12 "Why is identification different for AES and QES?" %}}
The legal identification requirements are not the same. QES is the highest standard and is equivalent to a handwritten signature. The identification requirements for QES are precisely defined in the law. With AES, providers have more freedom. When selecting identification procedures for AES, Skribble pays attention to simplicity of use and maximisation of legal weight.
