### General information
This cookie policy explains which cookies we use for which purposes on our website (skribble.com and my.skribble.com) and what options you have for handling cookies.

We use technology on our website to make the website easier to use and to improve the user-friendliness of the website or to provide various functionalities, thus making the website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Such technologies include cookies, pixels and scripts (hereinafter "cookies").

Cookies are small data sets that are stored on your terminal device and contain data such as personal page settings and login information. This data record is generated and sent to you by the web server with which you have established a connection via your web browser.

### Handling of cookies
In principle, it is also possible to access our website without cookies. You can object to the use of cookies at any time with effect for the future by setting your browser to accept no cookies or only certain cookies or by informing you as soon as cookies are sent. However, if you would like to use the functionalities of our website extensively, you should accept the cookies that enable the use of certain functions or make them more convenient. 

Most browsers accept cookies by default. Cookies can be rejected in the security settings. If you do not accept cookies, certain features on our website may not be available to you and some pages may not be displayed correctly. For detailed instructions on how to prevent cookies from being stored by changing your browser settings, please visit: [All About Cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org)

### Which cookies do we use?
By law, we may store cookies on your device if they are absolutely necessary for the operation of this website. For all other types of cookies we would like to ask you for your consent, which you can give us via the cookie banner or the consent management tool.

We generally use cookies of the following categories:

    <td>These cookies are used to perform advertising, web analytics, live chat and security measures. These include third party cookies.</td>

    <td>Statistics</td>
    <td>These cookies collect information about the way our website is used, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, error reports.</td>

    <td>Preferences (Functional)</td>
    <td>These cookies enable the website to store information already entered (such as user names, language settings) and to offer the user improved, more personalized functions.</td>

    <td>Required</td>
    <td>These cookies are essential for the website to function properly. Without these cookies, our services would not work.</td>
  </tr>

{{< /table-dense >}}

Cookies can also be permanent or temporary. So-called **permanent cookies** store a file for a certain period of time until the cookie expires on your terminal device or until you delete it manually. This saves e.g. language settings so that you do not have to make these settings again for our website. 

A so-called **session cookie** temporarily stores a session identification while you are active on the website. This prevents, for example, that you have to log in again when you change pages. Session cookies are deleted when you log out or lose their validity as soon as your session has expired.

Cookies can also be used as **third-party cookies**. Third-party cookies come from providers other than Skribble. For example, they may be used to collect information for advertising, custom content and web statistics.

The following is a summary of the cookies we use, which should inform you about the purpose and nature of each cookie and how long it is stored.
