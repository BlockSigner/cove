{{% markdown legal %}}
### Scope of application and conclusion of contract
1. These GTC are applicable to all services that Skribble provides to the Customer.
2. The Customer agrees to the application of these GTC by accepting Skribble's offer, by signing the cover sheet of the contract or by concluding a contract through the Skribble Services, which results in a customer contract (Customer Contract) between the Customer and Skribble. Any legal conditions that the Customer may wish to apply in addition are hereby rejected and shall therefore not apply. An express deviating regulation is reserved if both parties sign it.
3. For the use of certain services, the Customer must accept additional conditions of the trust service provider. The use of the Skribble Services by the System Users is governed by separate Terms of Use for System Users and the conditions of the trust service provider.


### Customers and System Users
1. Customer: A Skribble Customer may be a legal entity or a natural person.
2. System User: A System User is a natural person authorised to use the Skribble Services in accordance with the Terms of Use for System Users and identified by the Customer as authorised to use the Skribble Services.

### Accounts
1. Skribble provides the following accounts: Customer Accounts for Customers and User Accounts for System Users.
2. After the Customer Contract comes into force, Skribble shall provide the Customer with access data for the Customer Account, which enables them to create User Accounts or activate System Users respectively.

### Skribble Services
1. Skribble commits to the Customer to provide Skribble Services in the sense of a principal service under the Customer Contract. The Skribble Services as well as the conditions of use are described in the Customer Contract.
2. In order to sign documents with a qualified electronic signature (QES) or an advanced electronic signature (AES), an authentication of the signatory and a signature created by a certified service or trust service provider is required. Skribble integrates these components into its services with different trusted partners meeting the requirements of the ZertES and/or eIDAS.
3. In order to sign documents with a simple electronic signature (SES), only the access to the System User's email address is verified.
4. Skribble is neither a trust service provider nor a certification authority within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Electronic Signature Act (ZertES). Nor is Skribble a trust service provider within the meaning of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS No. 910/2014).  
5. Insofar as Skribble makes third-party services (including trust service providers / certification authorities / providers of electronic identities) accessible within the scope of Skribble Services, their availability as well as the quality requirements for such third-party services are governed by the provisions applicable to the respective third-party services. Skribble shall inform the Customer of the applicable provisions unless the Customer enters directly into a contractual relationship with the third party.  
6. Skribble endeavours to offer the Skribble Services on a continuous basis. However, Skribble is not responsible for the Skribble Services being available always. Skribble may temporarily restrict the availability if this is necessary, for example, in view of capacity limits or the security and integrity of the servers or for carrying out technical maintenance or repair work, and if this serves the purpose of providing or improving the Skribble Services properly (maintenance work). In doing so, Skribbles endeavours to accommodate the interests of the Customers or the System Users respectively.


### Increasing and reducing the Services
1. The Customer can request additional services at any time against payment of additional user fees.
